    # DOSDisplayToken (Default: Off): Values On or Off, Displays the module name
    #   and version in the ServerSignature when ServerTokens are set to full and
    #   ServerSignature is turned on. 
    DOSDisplayToken     Off
    # DOSHashTableSize (Default: 3097): The hash table size defines the number
    #   of top-level nodes for each child's hash table.  Increasing this number
    #   will provide faster performance by decreasing the number of iterations
    #   required to get to the record, but consume more memory for table space.
    #   You should increase this if you have a busy web server.  The value you
    #   specify will automatically be tiered up to the next prime number in the
    #   primes list (see mod_evasive.c for a list of primes used).
    DOSHashTableSize    3097
    # DOSPageCount (Default: 2): This is the threshhold for the number of
    #   requests for the same page (or URI) per page interval.  Once the
    #   threshhold for that interval has been exceeded, the IP address of the
    #   client will be added to the blocking list.
    DOSPageCount        5
    # DOSSiteCount (Default: 50): This is the threshhold for the total number
    #   of requests for any object by the same client on the same listener per
    #   site interval.  Once the threshhold for that interval has been exceeded,
    #   the IP address of the client will be added to the blocking list.
    DOSSiteCount        50
    # DOSPageInterval (Default: 1): The interval for the page count threshhold;
    #   defaults to 1 second intervals.
    DOSPageInterval     1
    # DOSSiteInterval (Default: 1): The interval for the site count threshhold;
    #   defaults to 1 second intervals.
    DOSSiteInterval     1
    # DOSBlockingPeriod (Default: 10): The blocking period is the amount of time
    #   (in seconds) that a client will be blocked for if they are added to the
    #   blocking list.  During this time, all subsequent requests from the
    #   client will result in a 503 (Forbidden) and the timer being reset (e.g.
    #   another 10 seconds).  Since the timer is reset for every subsequent
    #   request, it is not necessary to have a long blocking period; in the
    #   event of a DoS attack, this timer will keep getting reset.
    DOSBlockingPeriod   60
    # DOSSystemCommand (experimental on Windows and untested): If this value is
    #   set, the system command specified will be executed whenever an IP
    #   address becomes blacklisted.  This is designed to enable system calls
    #   to ip filter or other tools.  A locking mechanism using /tmp prevents
    #   continuous system calls.  Use %s to denote the IP address of the
    #   blacklisted IP.
    #DOSSystemCommand	"C:/SomeAppDir/someapp.exe %s"
    # DOSLogDir: Choose an alternative temp directory
    DOSLogDir           "${FF_LOGSDIR}"
    # DOSWhitelist: IP addresses of trusted clients can be whitelisted to insure
    #   they are never denied.  The purpose of whitelisting is to protect
    #   software, scripts, local searchbots, or other automated tools from being
    #   denied for requesting large amounts of data from the server.
    #   Whitelisting should *not* be used to add customer lists or anything of
    #   the sort, as this will open the server to abuse. This module is very
    #   difficult to trigger without performing some type of malicious attack,
    #   and for that reason it is more appropriate to allow the module to decide
    #   on its own whether or not an individual customer should be blocked.
	#   To whitelist an address (or range) add an entry to the Apache
    #   configuration in the following fashion:
    #   Wildcards can be used on up to the last 3 octets if necessary.  Multiple
    #   DOSWhitelist commands may be used in the configuration.
    DOSWhitelist        127.*.*.*
	DOSWhitelist        ::1
    DOSWhitelist        9.*.*.*
	DOSWhitelist        10.*.*.*
	DOSWhitelist        192.*.*.*
    # TWEAKING APACHE
    # The keep-alive settings for your children should be reasonable enough to
    # keep each child up long enough to resist a DOS attack (or at least part of
    # one).  Remember, it is the child processes that maintain their own internal
    # IP address tables, and so when one exits, so does all of the IP information it
    # had. For every child that exits, another 5-10 copies of the page may get 
    # through before putting the attacker back into '503 Land'.  With this said, 
    # you should have a very high MaxRequestsPerChild, but not unlimited as this
    # will prevent cleanup.
    # 
    # You'll want to have a MaxRequestsPerChild set to a non-zero value, as
    # DosEvasive cleans up its internal hashes only on exit.  The default
    # MaxRequestsPerChild is usually 10000.  This should suffice in only allowing
    # a few requests per 10000 per child through in the event of an attack (although
    # if you use DOSSystemCommand to firewall the IP address, a hole will no
    # longer be open in between child cycles).
